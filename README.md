### Example
```
import cohere

# Initialize Cohere client
co = cohere.Client('your-api-key-here')

def get_response(prompt):
    response = co.generate(
        model='command-r',
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=50
    )
    return response.generations[0].text

# Test the chatbot
prompt = "Tell me about Aristotle's philosophy."
response = get_response(prompt)
print(response)
